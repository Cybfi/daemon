# Welcome to Cyber Daemon!

Cyber Daemon does the following things:

- [x] Takes a screenshot and parses it for text, then "checklisting" it

- [x] Reads keyboard input and parses it for sentences, then "checklisting" it

- [ ] Enforces policies defined on Cybfi Servers

- [ ] Validates the installation

- [ ] Communicates with the AI server

All data is given a preliminary check, based on the current AI model, before being sent for review. For example, a clean message must have a word in it that also frequently occured in potentially harmful messages before being sent to the AI. Some obsenities have mulitple definitions, so this isn't fool proof, however it does keep a sense of privacy.

Auditors are always welcome!
